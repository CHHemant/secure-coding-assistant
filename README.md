# Secure Coding Assistant (AI Bot)

## Overview

The **Secure Coding Assistant** is an AI-powered chatbot that helps developers write more secure code by reviewing code snippets and providing actionable security recommendations. It combines static code analysis (rule-based checks) with advanced AI (using OpenAI's language models) to identify vulnerabilities and suggest best practices. This tool is designed to seamlessly assist developers during their workflow, making secure coding accessible and efficient.

## Features

- **Static Security Checks:**  
  Quickly identifies common vulnerabilities such as hardcoded passwords, SQL injection, buffer overflows, and more.

- **AI-Powered Suggestions:**  
  Uses state-of-the-art AI (OpenAI API) to review code and provide tailored recommendations and improvements.

- **Easy-to-Use Web Interface:**  
  Submit code snippets and receive feedback instantly via a simple web form.

- **Extensible and Customizable:**  
  Add new rules or integrate with other AI models to enhance security checks for different languages and frameworks.

- **Open Source:**  
  Modify and adapt the project for your specific needs.

---

## How It Works

1. **User submits code snippet** via the web interface.
2. **Static analyzer** runs a set of rule-based checks to catch common vulnerabilities.
3. **AI engine** processes the code using a large language model (OpenAI) and generates recommendations for secure coding and fixes for identified issues.
4. **Results are displayed**, showing both static analysis findings and AI-generated suggestions.

## Why Use Secure Coding Assistant?

- **Comprehensive Checks:**  
  Combines the speed and reliability of static analysis with the flexibility and intelligence of AI.

- **Developer-Friendly:**  
  Instant feedback means you catch vulnerabilities before code review or deployment.

- **Language-Agnostic:**  
  Easily extendable to support multiple programming languages and frameworks.

- **Proactive Security:**  
  Helps cultivate a “security-first” mindset from the earliest stages of development, reducing risk and cost of vulnerabilities.

- **Better than Manual Review:**  
  Manual code reviews may miss subtle security bugs; this tool is designed to catch both obvious and non-obvious issues.

- **AI Augmentation:**  
  Leverages the latest advancements in AI to keep up with evolving security threats and coding practices.
